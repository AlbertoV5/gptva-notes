# GPT Voice Assistant Notes

This repository contains notes for a Python program for using GPT from OpenAI as a voice assistant.


## Plan

The plan is to create 5 different articles that tackle different sections of the program by functionality.

1.  Part 1 - Audio Channel
2.  Part 2 - AI Models and Services
3.  Part 3 - Web Server and Storage
4.  Part 4 - Flow and Conclusion

Part 1 will contain audio theory and practice for audio device, torchaudio, toml config file and audio calibration.

Part 2 will contain constructing classes for loading up local AI models, as well as connecting to remote AI services, plus loading SSML and a YAML file.

Part 3 will contain a simple SQL database, threading and a web socket server for serving HTML and updating messages in real time.

Part 4 will refine the application flow, setup commands, add extra functionality and suggest possible future improvements.
